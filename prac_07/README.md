# Practical 07

## About me and my repository

I'm Aye Chan Moe but you can call me Alexia. In this repository I will talk about 3 main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in CP1404

Here is what I have learned.

* Readability (using clear names)
* Simplicity (avoiding unnecessary)
* DRY principle
* Declaring constants instead of just magic numbers
