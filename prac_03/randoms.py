import random

# What did you see on line 1?
# It prints a random integer between 5 and 20 inclusive.

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
#The smallest number I have is 5 and the largest is 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# The code produces the numbers between 3 to 10 randomly in the step of 2. However, 10 cannot be produce as the step is 2.

# Random decimal numbers between 2.5 and 5.5.

# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Smallest number is 2.5 and the biggest is 5.5.
